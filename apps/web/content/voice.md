# Arc Voice & Tone Guide

## Voice Principles

### 1. Creator-First
We speak the language of creators and SMBs who are building something meaningful. We understand the hustle, the pressure to perform, and the need for data that actually helps.

**Do:**
- "Your last 5 posts are pulling weight"
- "Time to double down on that angle" 
- "Your crew is most active Tue 7–9pm"

**Don't:**
- "Optimize your content performance metrics"
- "Leverage data-driven insights for engagement"
- "Maximize your ROI potential"

### 2. Confident but Human
We're confident in our data and recommendations, but we're not robotic or sterile. We have personality without being unprofessional.

**Do:**
- "We fumbled that fetch. Retrying with cooler hands…"
- "Whoa there, speedy. Give us a second to catch up"
- "Your audience is here for it"

**Don't:**
- "Error 500: Internal server error"
- "Request timeout. Please try again later"
- "System unavailable"

### 3. Actionable Intelligence
Every piece of copy should move the user toward a decision or action. We don't just present data—we tell you what to do with it.

**Do:**
- "Prime time: your crew is most active Tue 7–9pm"
- "Google Ads is crushing it. Maybe time to reallocate some Meta budget?"
- "These topic clusters show what really resonates"

**Don't:**
- "Tuesday has the highest engagement"
- "Google Ads performance exceeds Meta Ads"
- "Topic analysis complete"

## Tone Guidelines

### Casual but Professional
We're the friend who happens to be really good with data. Approachable expertise.

### Optimistic but Realistic
We believe in growth and success, but we don't oversell or promise magic bullets.

### Specific over Generic
"Your last 5 posts" instead of "recent content." "Tue 7–9pm" instead of "peak hours."

## Word Choices

### Use These:
- "vibes" (for sentiment/feeling)
- "crew" (for audience)
- "pull weight" (for performance)
- "crushing it" (for success)
- "fire" (for quality content)
- "drop" (for posting content)
- "signal" vs "noise"
- "level up"
- "double down"
- "spark the magic"

### Avoid These:
- "leverage"
- "optimize" 
- "utilize"
- "solutions"
- "innovative"
- "best-in-class"
- "cutting-edge"
- "revolutionary"

## Content Types

### Headlines
- Short, punchy, benefit-focused
- "Turn vibes into revenue"
- "Skim the signal"
- "Prime time posting"

### Descriptions
- Explain the "why" and "what's in it for me"
- Use active voice
- Include specific outcomes

### Error Messages
- Acknowledge the frustration
- Use humor when appropriate
- Always provide next steps
- "We fumbled that fetch. Retrying with cooler hands…"

### Empty States
- Acknowledge the emptiness without blame
- Provide clear path to value
- Maintain optimistic tone
- "Quiet for now. Drop a CSV or connect a channel to spark the magic."

### Help Text
- Assume intelligence, explain complexity
- Use examples and context
- Avoid jargon without explanation

## Platform-Specific Voice

### YouTube
- "videos" not "content"
- "subscribers" not "followers"
- "comments" not "engagement"

### Instagram
- "posts" and "stories"
- "followers" 
- "saves" and "shares"

### TikTok
- "drops" for posts
- "For You Page" or "FYP"
- "views" and "shares"

## Accessibility Notes

- Always provide alt text for emotions/reactions
- Spell out abbreviations on first use
- Use clear, descriptive link text
- Avoid color-only information

## Examples by Context

### Success States
- "Connected! Data should start flowing in the next few minutes."
- "Campaign created. Time to watch those numbers climb."
- "Upload complete. We're analyzing your comments now."

### Loading States
- "Crunching the numbers..."
- "Fetching your latest comments..."
- "Cooking up some recommendations..."

### Confirmation Modals
- "Are you sure you want to disconnect YouTube? You'll lose all that juicy data."
- "Delete this campaign? This can't be undone."
- "Ready to archive this workspace?"

### Onboarding
- "Let's connect your channels and get you set up"
- "Almost there! Just a few more details"
- "You're all set! Time to explore your data"

Remember: Every word should earn its place. If it doesn't help the user understand or take action, cut it.
